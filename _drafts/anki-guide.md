## Getting started

If you're just starting to use Anki or have never used it before, here are the three-ish things you need to do:

1. Find a reason (studying language/med school/etc.) that you *actually care about*
2. Make a deck
3. Write some (1-10) front/back (Basic) cards
4. Study

If you can't find a reason, then don't use Anki. Come back once you have a good reason to try and memorize things. 

If you only add between 1-10 cards a day, then your review time should be a few minutes max. I also recommend keeping things as simple as possible by only clicking 'Again' if you didn't remember something and 'Good' if you did. Ignore the other buttons.

## Starting with Anki

Now that it's a habit... well there's not much more to it. Once you've done it for a while, you'll start to get a feel for what cards are good and what aren't.
