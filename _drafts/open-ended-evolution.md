Since I've been asked so many times what my research is on, here's my best shot at explaining **open-endedness**. Evolution is what we would call an "open-ended" system in that it has ran for billions of years and continues generating new and interesting life forms.

The overarching goal of the field is to create something truly open-ended at the level of biological evolution.

So how far along are we on this goal? I would say that even the definition of what *is* an open-ended system is not so clear. What are the hallmarks that an open-ended system has to have? How can you tell whether a system's capability to innovate is bounded or unbounded? How do you even create a system that would be conventionally understood as open-ended?

My personal classification of open-ended research falls into 2 categories: **hallmarks** and **mechanisms**.

Hallmarks are papers which posit the *necessary* metrics a system must meet in order to be classified as. Some examples include

1. Do you have diversity of components?
2. Is the # of unique fundamental units increasing with time?
3. Are you getting change from generation to generation?
4. Are organisms getting more complex with time?

Mechanism papers try to create systems that have the currently accepted hallmarks of open-endedness. Sometimes like the [Chromaria](https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/alife2014/26/793/98965) paper, they also put out a list of traits they think such systems need to exhibit. Some common ones are:

1. Adaptive fitness landscape
2. Embodied agents
3. Agent interaction
4. Unlimited phenotype space
5. Coevolution
6. Minimal criterion for reproduction

You can kind of think of these two components as a synergistic loop. Hallmarks set the benchmark which mechanism papers try to beat which further clarifies what metrics need to look like, so on and so forth.[^1]
