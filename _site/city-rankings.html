    <h1><a href="/"a>← Every City Ranked</a></h1>
    <p class="date">Dec 24, 2021 &ndash; Feb 04, 2023</p>
    <main>
      <p>Compiling a tier list of every city I’ve visited along with
      some rationale behind why I think that. Very not comprehensive,
      and very much in need of more cities!</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Note: I’m ranking the cities off of how much I enjoyed them.
      I’ve spent varying amounts of time in different cities and visited
      them for very different reasons (sometimes I’ve lived in a place
      and other times it’s just for tourism). This list is completely
      subjective and probably will mean nothing to you.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="t">T</h2>
      <h3 id="tokyo">Tokyo</h3>
      <p><strong>2024 (1 week)</strong></p>
      <p>Special rank for Tokyo. First of all, their transit system is
      <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farebox_recovery_ratio#Oceania">profitable!!</a>
      which is genuinely not something you can find in the US. I haven’t
      dug too deep into what’s different, but the Tokyo Metro/JR
      Lines/Shinkansen are by the far the greatest metro system I’ve
      ever used, hands down. Beyond that, the food was amazing, culture
      was amazing, and might be my favorite city in the world now.</p>
      <h2 id="s">S</h2>
      <h3 id="paris">Paris</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~1 week)</strong></p>
      <p>The most magical thing walking out of our Airbnb, going 2
      blocks surrounded by beautiful architecture, and buying fresh
      groceries from a local store. Nothing else has come quite close to
      this. Also everything in Paris was just amazing, very glad I
      didn’t suffer <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome">Paris
      Syndrome</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="toronto">Toronto</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~3 days)</strong></p>
      <p>All the perks of NY but clean.</p>
      <h3 id="new-york-city">New York City</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~3 days)</strong></p>
      <p>The metro system is amazing, and there was just so much to do
      and see. Absolute hodgepodge of cultures and personalities. Also
      the fact I could basically cross any street without fear of dying
      was a very nice reprieve from Orlando.</p>
      <h3 id="takayama">Takayama</h3>
      <p><strong>2024 (2 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Does Takayama really deserve to be an S tier city? Debatable.
      Am I putting it here because Hida Beef is pretty much the best
      food I have ever eaten? Possibly. I’m also putting it here because
      small Japanese city/towns are some of the most charming in the
      world. Genuinely loved the slower pace of life here, and the food
      and views were stunning.</p>
      <h2 id="a">A</h2>
      <h2 id="boston">Boston</h2>
      <p><strong>2021 (~2 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Walkable city with pretty architecture and surprisingly good
      food. I suppose MIT and Harvard… and BU and BC and <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_metropolitan_Boston">at
      least 20 other universities</a> are there, so if you like an
      academic vibe, then this is the place to be. To me, it’s a
      prototypical Northeastern U.S. city.</p>
      <h2 id="charleston">Charleston</h2>
      <p><strong>2022 (~1 week)</strong></p>
      <p>Lots of culture here, and the whole city is pretty walkable!
      Lovely river, great farmer’s markets, and you’re never too far
      from nature. Even <em>after</em> getting stuck in the woods til
      2am one of the days, this is still an A rating for me.</p>
      <h2 id="san-diego">San Diego</h2>
      <p><strong>2023 (~5 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Temperate weather and absolute amazing Mexican food! Lots of
      pretty attractions, and I liked the less frenetic pace of the city
      and surrounding metro areas. But oh man, that mexican food was to
      die for, as in the 5 California burritos I consumed per day will
      probably kill me.</p>
      <h2 id="b">B</h2>
      <h3 id="hiroshima">Hiroshima</h3>
      <p><strong>2024 (2 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Once again, this is not a fair ranking because… well. Right.
      The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and historical significance
      alone makes it worth visiting, but the day trip to Miyajima
      (little island off the coast) made the trip far better and gave a
      nice sense of nature to the otherwise bustling city.</p>
      <h3 id="kyoto">Kyoto</h3>
      <p><strong>2024 (2 days)</strong></p>
      <p>They have a really lovely train station that has an amazing
      light show at night, beautiful views as always. There’s an amazing
      torii gate walk (the one with thousands of torii gates) and the
      Imperial Palace to boot. I was feeling quite under the weather, so
      this may not be the most accurate rating ever.</p>
      <h3 id="hershey">Hershey</h3>
      <p><strong>2017 — 2019 (2 years)</strong></p>
      <p>There’s a cool amusement park, and this is <em>the</em>
      Hershey, like the chocolate company. Once again, I think me living
      there makes me rate it a bit poorly, but it’s a lovely little
      town. Just be aware that there’s a non-zero chance it smells like
      manure while driving around.</p>
      <h3 id="ann-arbor">Ann Arbor</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~2 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Quaint little college town, UM is a very pretty campus, and not
      much more to be said.</p>
      <h2 id="c">C</h2>
      <h3 id="kanazawa">Kanazawa</h3>
      <p><strong>2024 (2 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Felt like a generic medium sized Japanese city. Some nice
      attractions and good food, but nothing to really right home about.
      That being said, you should visit their <a
      href="https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/attractions/detail_52123.html">Ninja
      Weapon Museum</a>! Pretty quiet but peaceful.</p>
      <h3 id="lansingeast-lansing">Lansing/East Lansing</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~3 months)</strong></p>
      <p>Besides the <a
      href="https://statenews.com/article/2023/09/the-mystery-behind-the-msu-dairy-store?ct=content_open&amp;cv=cbox_latest">amazing
      ice cream</a>, I don’t think any normal human would want to come
      visit Lansing/East Lansing. Relatively quiet college town, but it
      is quite pretty and there are tons of nature trails.</p>
      <h3 id="beijing">Beijing</h3>
      <p><strong>2018 (~1 week)</strong></p>
      <p>Don’t remember too much, but the smog was a very clear memory.
      Pretty sure there wasn’t a single clear/sunny day, so although I
      liked the architecture, it’s getting bumped down.</p>
      <h2 id="d">D</h2>
      <h3 id="detroit">Detroit</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~2 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Mildly felt like a ghost-town celebrating its past success
      while on last legs.</p>
      <h3 id="miami">Miami</h3>
      <p><strong>2019 — 2021, (2 years)</strong></p>
      <p>Lived here and most of the time was during COVID, so I feel
      like this is a poor rating, but I can’t rate it any higher. (I’ve
      never explored the city fully, so this is <em>definitely</em> an
      inaccurate rating you shouldn’t listen to)</p>
      <h3 id="orlando">Orlando</h3>
      <p><strong>2021- 2023, (2 years)</strong></p>
      <p>Perhaps it’s because I live here, but not much to write home
      about. Poor walkability and besides Disney &amp; Universal Park,
      Orlando, and a few cute spots like Baldwin Park and Winter Garden,
      there isn’t much to see. This is a place to visit for a weekend
      for the amusement parks, but I definitely wouldn’t stay here long
      term.</p>
