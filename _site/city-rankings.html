    <h1><a href="/"a>← Every City Ranked</a></h1>
    <p class="date">Dec 24, 2021 &ndash; Dec 24, 2023</p>
    <main>
      <p>Compiling a tier list of every city I’ve visited along with
      some rationale behind why I think that. Very not comprehensive,
      and very much in need of more cities!</p>
      <h2 id="s">S</h2>
      <h3 id="paris">Paris</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~1 week)</strong></p>
      <p>The most magical thing walking out of our Airbnb, going 2
      blocks surrounded by beautiful architecture, and buying fresh
      groceries from a local store. Nothing else has come quite close to
      this. Also everything in Paris was just amazing, very glad I
      didn’t suffer <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome">Paris
      Syndrome</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="toronto">Toronto</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~3 days)</strong></p>
      <p>All the perks of NY but clean.</p>
      <h3 id="new-york-city">New York City</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~3 days)</strong></p>
      <p>The metro system is amazing, and there was just so much to do
      and see. Absolute hodgepodge of cultures and personalities. Also
      the fact I could basically cross any street without fear of dying
      was a very nice reprieve from Orlando.</p>
      <h2 id="a">A</h2>
      <h2 id="boston">Boston</h2>
      <p><strong>2021 (~2 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Walkable city with pretty architecture and surprisingly good
      food. I suppose MIT and Harvard… and BU and BC and <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_metropolitan_Boston">at
      least 20 other universities</a> are there, so if you like an
      academic vibe, then this is the place to be. To me, it’s a
      prototypical Northeastern U.S. city.</p>
      <h2 id="san-diego">San Diego</h2>
      <p><strong>2023 (~5 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Temperate weather and absolute amazing Mexican food! Lots of
      pretty attractions, and I liked the less frenetic pace of the city
      and surrounding metro areas. But oh man, that mexican food was to
      die for, as in the 5 California burritos I consumed per day will
      probably kill me.</p>
      <h2 id="b">B</h2>
      <h3 id="hershey">Hershey</h3>
      <p><strong>2017 — 2019 (2 years)</strong></p>
      <p>There’s a cool amusement park, and this is <em>the</em>
      Hershey, like the chocolate company. Once again, I think me living
      there makes me rate it a bit poorly, but it’s a lovely little
      town. Just be aware that there’s a non-zero chance it smells like
      manure while driving around.</p>
      <h3 id="ann-arbor">Ann Arbor</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~2 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Quaint little college town, UM is a very pretty campus, and not
      much more to be said.</p>
      <h2 id="c">C</h2>
      <h3 id="lansingeast-lansing">Lansing/East Lansing</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~3 months)</strong></p>
      <p>Besides the <a
      href="https://statenews.com/article/2023/09/the-mystery-behind-the-msu-dairy-store?ct=content_open&amp;cv=cbox_latest">amazing
      ice cream</a>, I don’t think any normal human would want to come
      visit Lansing/East Lansing. Relatively quiet college town, but it
      is quite pretty and there are tons of nature trails.</p>
      <h3 id="beijing">Beijing</h3>
      <p><strong>2018 (~1 week)</strong></p>
      <p>Don’t remember too much, but the smog was a very clear memory.
      Pretty sure there wasn’t a single clear/sunny day, so although I
      liked the architecture, it’s getting bumped down.</p>
      <h2 id="d">D</h2>
      <h3 id="detroit">Detroit</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 (~2 days)</strong></p>
      <p>Mildly felt like a ghost-town celebrating its past success
      while on last legs.</p>
      <h3 id="miami">Miami</h3>
      <p><strong>2019 — 2021, (2 years)</strong></p>
      <p>Lived here and most of the time was during COVID, so I feel
      like this is a poor rating, but I can’t rate it any higher. (I’ve
      never explored the city fully, so this is <em>definitely</em> an
      inaccurate rating you shouldn’t listen to)</p>
      <h3 id="orlando">Orlando</h3>
      <p><strong>2021- 2023, (2 years)</strong></p>
      <p>Perhaps it’s because I live here, but not much to write home
      about. Poor walkability and besides Disney, Orlando, and a few
      cute spots like Baldwin Park and Winter Garden, there isn’t much
      to see.</p>
