    <h1><a href="/"a>← Cooperation across scales</a></h1>
    <p class="date">Dec 06, 2023 &ndash; Jan 02, 2024</p>
    <main>
      <p>Humans cooperate, but so do cells, and then so do chemical
      autocatalytic cycles? What is the lowest level where we can say
      that “cooperation” occurs not as a law of physics, but as an
      evolved thing where it is beneficial to “work together”. (This
      needs refining since <em>everything</em> is a law of physics)</p>
      <p>Reading about the origin of life, it’s interesting that they’re
      talking about autopoiesis and how it might have evolved in a
      pre-biology standpoint just because it was favorable for chemical
      cycles to stick together. Is this then cooperation?</p>
      <h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Q: How do we build cooperation and trust?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Recent GraphNet paper kind of talked about this, but it was
      very small scale. Right now, I’m thinking of how it might be the
      role of technology or <a href="urban-planning">urban planning</a>
      to help foster cooperation. Jane Jacob’s idea of eyes on the
      street is one, that you can <em>build</em> cities which create
      cooperation and trust. This is kind of amazing. It isn’t forcing
      people to, you just give people the affordances to trust and
      build.</p>
      <p>Do we have any social media that <em>truly</em> tries to build
      in affordances of trust? What would that even look like? Somehow,
      this also ties into the question of how we increase the agency of
      kids. It is fundamentally a problem of cooperation and trust.</p>
