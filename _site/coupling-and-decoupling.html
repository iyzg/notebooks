    <title>Coupling &amp; Decoupling</title>

    <h1><a href="/"a>← Coupling &amp; Decoupling</a></h1>
    <p class="date">Jan 10, 2024 &ndash; Feb 15, 2024</p>
    <main>
      <p>What is coupling? A coupling, by definition, is a pairing. When
      two people become a couple, they, by definition and by common
      sense, are pairing their future togethers. Of course, there are
      levels to how tightly coupled two systems are, but that is the
      rough idea. Decoupling is the same thing but in the other
      direction.</p>
      <p>Now, this is a pretty simple idea. Ye, you can pair two things
      together and take them apart, but for some reason, I’ve been
      seeing this applied everywhere. Here’s a little compiled list of
      where I’m been seeing this.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a
      href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/measuring-quarterly-economic-growth-outer-space#:~:text=Satellite%20images%20of%20nighttime%20lights,small%20spatial%20units%20over%20time.">Lights
      &amp; economic development</a>: Okay, this is absolute insanity.
      It turns out that you can tie GDP to satellite images, and… just
      think about that for a second. Not just satellite images of
      buildings or what not but lights. Of course, this is becoming a
      bit less true now that richer places can afford LEDs, but I’m sure
      there’s still some way this can be applied.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_regulator">Good
      regulator theorem</a></li>
      <li>Neural net scaling: is magic? Never before do I think we’ve
      had such a tight linkage between money and “intelligence” (I use
      the word very loosely here). I suppose you can count making more
      humans through more money counts, but the fact it’s an artificial
      intelligence makes it all the more fascinating.</li>
      <li>Thermometers: The old therometers we had as a kid would have
      alcohol/mercury (yummy) inside a tube which would go up and down
      as the temperature changed. Could be considered a tightly linked
      system</li>
      <li>Malthusian Trap: For almost all of human history, we’ve been
      trapped between linear production of food and exponential growth
      of human population, but it seems we’ve finally broken free of
      that.</li>
      <li><a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_horse_manure_crisis_of_1894">Great
      horse manure crisis</a>: Researchers predicted that London would
      be drowned in a sea of horse poop since productivity and horse
      poop (from transportation of goods and humans) were tightly
      linked. Although cars today have a not so great reputation for
      once again linking transportation with general pollution and
      climate change, they did manage to unlink travel from horse poop
      which is something I’m very grateful of. You might just see this
      as a negative externality where the consequences of your actions
      aren’t directly visible (smelly poop) and instead are invisible to
      the human eye yet might cause devastation to our globe.</li>
