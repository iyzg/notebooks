      <h2 id="science-of-diversity">“Science” of diversity</h2>
      <p>I think part of “beef” with diversity is that a lot of the
      computational studies of it seem to be toy problems that don’t say
      much and can have results flipped with different parameters. When
      we study diversity in the real world, I think a large part of the
      focus is on racial diversity (which is extremely important!), but
      I think the a question that gets left by the wayside is measuring
      diversity of thought. (perhaps because this is intractable)</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>I should note, the problem I have with computational diversity
      studies extends to any form of computational modelling where the
      scientist is able to build in their own biases.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Maybe you could use some sort of cosine similarity between the
      members of a lab as a measure of diversity. This seems dumb for
      multiple reasons. Firstly, people in a lab will work together, so
      they’ll have a lot of overlap on the kinds of papers they write.
      Or perhaps you encode their papers/work before they join a lab as
      a measure of diversity? This could be interesting and as far as
      metrics go, it seems as flawed/rigorous as any I’ve stumbled
      across.</p>
      <h2 id="how-to-avoid-monoculture">How to avoid monoculture?</h2>
      <p>A lot of these papers point out the damage of monoculture! The
      most striking being the paper which showed that employers which
      all use an “optimal” automated hiring process can instead hiring a
      suboptimal subset of employees. We have strength in diversity, but
      there are so many pressures socially to conform.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>From <a href="open-questions">open questions</a>, <strong>How
      can you measure tradeoff between conformity and
      diversity?</strong> There is strength in diversity, but it seems
      like there is also a lot of social push for conformity. Is there
      an optimal balance? What kind of metrics would someone use to
      measure these?</p>
