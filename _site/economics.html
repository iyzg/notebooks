      <p>Yes, I know this is really a massive field, but I’m keeping it
      as one page until I can break it up myself. It is very scattered
      thoughts as I learn more and talk to more people.</p>

      Principles of Economics</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Economics is the study of <em>scarcity</em>. When you want to
      have everything, but you cannot afford to get it all, how do you
      best allocate these resources? Notice, that this definition does
      not talk about money, since economics is not truly about money.
      Money is just one way that economics can arise and where the
      problem of scarcity is very much felt. You can also study it on
      different units like time, incentives, etc.</p>
      <p>Money is one of the greatest human stories of all time. If you
      asked the people during bartering times, how can you ensure that
      the work a farmer does can be traded for a blacksmith but across
      all disciplines, this is essentially <span
      class="math inline">O(N^2)</span>. But by having this common
      resource and each acting selfishly, we’re somehow able to
      coordinate. (Does this count as a form of <a
      href="complex-systems">complex system</a>?)</p>
      <p>Specialization only is powerful is people do their own thing
      however.</p>
      <h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>What kind of markets lead to the least waste?
      <ul>
      <li>It seems like the textbook I was reading sort of assumes a
      well-mixed population such that each buyer and seller are the
      same, but in the real world, that is not the case. Are there
      networks where you can inhibit economic convergence?</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>What is the price of a human life?</li>
      <li>Is EBay creating value or simply helping people out? (This
      question is poorly phrased.) Like is the value of the item
      intrinsic or only created as a result of the market it is exposed
      to and itself.
      <ul>
      <li>Does anything have value within itself? This is like the koan
      of if a tree fell in a forest but no one heard, has it really
      fallen?</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>How have social media and mass consumption affected
      specialization?</li>
      </ul>
