      <p>Consistently, subjects showed higher brain activations
      indorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex
      inthe post-test than inthe pre-test. Inaddition, there were
      significant positive correlations self-reported search impulse and
      brain responses inthe frontal areas. The results suggest that
      asimple six-day’s Internet search training can make people
      dependent on the search tools when facing unknown issues. People
      are easily dependent on the Internet search engines.</p>

      <p>Overall, the available evidence indicates that the Internet can
      produce both acute and sustained alterations in each of these
      areas of cognition, which may be reflected in changes in the
      brain. However, an emerging priority for future research is to
      determine the effects of extensive online media usage on cognitive
      development in youth, and examine how this may differ from
      cognitive outcomes and brain impact of uses of Internet in the
      elderly. We conclude by proposing how Internet research could be
      integrated into broader research settings to study how this
      unprecedented new facet of society can affect our cognition and
      the brain across the life course.</p>

      <p>Analysis showed a significant effect for both setting and use
      of a laptop as well as a significant interaction between setting
      and laptop use. A further analysis controlling for time spent
      focused on the laptop screen produced similar results. The
      findings show that using an electronic device in green settings
      substantially counteracts the attention enhancement benefits of
      green spaces.</p>

      <p>No one has ever asked me how one should escape mimetic
      contagion on campus. Still here’s my answer: If one must go to
      college, I advise cultivating smaller social circles. Instead of
      going to class and preparing for exams, to go to the library and
      just read. Finally, not to join a fraternity or finance club, but
      to be part of a knitting circle or hiking group instead.</p>

      <p>The needle mover for really changing your life is your
      environment. Living in the wrong city can drastically increase
      your odds of developing diabetes. People surrounded by runners
      start running themselves. The key to getting whatever you want
      (becoming happier, becoming smarter, quitting smoking, working
      more, working less, etc) is identifying an environment that has
      those virtues and immersing yourself in it. But how? “Environment”
      is just code for a collection of other people, places or things
      that you experience without applying continuous effort.</p>
