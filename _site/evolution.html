    <h1><a href="/"a>← Evolution</a></h1>
    <p class="date">Dec 24, 2023 &ndash; Dec 24, 2023</p>
    <main>
      <p>Far too expansive of a topic to cover in one notebook, but I’m
      going to try and start keeping notes on this!</p>
      <p>Firstly, I want to explore evolution in many different forms.
      Evolution as:</p>
      <h2 id="as-a-minimal-criterion">as a minimal criterion</h2>
      <p>Although evolution is often seen as a force of convergence, you
      might also see it as a <em>diffusion operator</em>. Rather than
      humans being the “peak” of evolution, we’re just one niche in a
      world with millions(?) of niches. You don’t need to be the
      <em>most</em> fit to reproduce, simply fit enough. This gives a
      lot of leeway for what is able to reproduce.</p>
      <p>Stephen Gould’s <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_House:_The_Spread_of_Excellence_from_Plato_to_Darwin">Full
      House</a> covers this and on the computational side, <a
      href="http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/brant_gecco17.pdf">Kenneth
      Stanley</a> has done a lot of work in this area too.</p>
      <h2 id="as-a-novelty-creator">as a novelty creator</h2>
      <p>Another way to view evolution is through creating new niches
      and novel creatures. How exactly such a simple process can seem to
      infinitely create <em>new</em> things is still an open problem. My
      hunch is that it isn’t that evolution is so deep that makes it
      amazing, but that the environment it is in is so complex. Any
      simple enough algorithm in a complex enough substrate can produce
      wonders. (See <a href="ai">AI</a> for more on the Bitter Lesson)!
      This is also why I see so much promise with neural networks and
      reinforcement learning. If you can create something that can
      <em>always</em> scale with <em>more</em> data/learning, then the
      primary challenge is to give it a more complex environment!</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>One idea here is that coevolution is a key thing missing from
      our current DL models. They learn on “static” distributions, but
      this limits the complexity. You can always grow it by collecting
      more data, but like evolution, we’d like something that can
      naturally complexify. Something to <a
      href="learning-list">study</a> is why GANs fail and how we might
      make them work better?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="as-an-optimization-tool">as an optimization tool</h2>
      <p>Even though the minimal criterion suggests that evolution
      creates different niches that can coexist, this idea of “survival
      of the fittest” has been adapted to create tools that can search
      for optimal solutions given a problem. Generally they go under the
      name of genetic algorithms or evolutionary strategies and vary on
      how biologically inspired they are.</p>
