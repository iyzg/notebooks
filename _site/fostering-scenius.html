    <h1><a href="/"a>← Fostering scenius</a></h1>
    <p class="date">Dec 05, 2023 &ndash; Dec 16, 2023</p>
    <main>
      <p><a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/scenius-or-comm/">Kevin
      Kelly</a> and <a
      href="https://www.packym.com/blog/conjuring-scenius">Packy
      McCormick</a> have both written about this idea of the “scenius”.
      The idea that the lone genius is a false myth and that the greats
      were surrounded by a scene (hence the pun) which made them
      great.</p>
      <p>This has got me thinking too about what exactly it is you need
      to create a scenius &amp; can they even be conjured up in the
      first place? A rough analogy is that I think it’s a bit like
      writing. People have all these creative and wild ideas they want
      to pursue, but until they’re given an outlet, they’ll never even
      realize that was there. The analogy in writing for me is that I
      don’t realize I have ideas either or that there’s something to be
      found until I start searching by putting words on a screen.</p>
      <p>As I’ve hosted presentation nights this year, let’s see if I’ve
      learned anything. What would I tell myself if I could go back to
      improve how these are planned?</p>
      <h3 id="vibes-are-everything">Vibes are everything</h3>
      <p>I think setting the correct vibe is do-or-die for whether a
      scenius survives. There has to be this camaraderie and internal
      urge to push each other on. To me, it also feels important to
      avoid a complete sausage-fest or STEM takeover, but that’s
      something I have to work on myself, so no tips on that. If
      anything, I’d say it’s important to have at least one very close
      friend in outside circles who are able to bring diversity to these
      events until it is self generating.</p>
      <h3 id="minimal-bounds">Minimal bounds</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="living-computation">living computation</a> which
      I’ve been thinking a lot about, I think a big part of allowing for
      open-ended creativity is by setting the minimum bounds possible
      while ensuring that people must breach new ground. For most, this
      is a strict no work or school allowed, but is that rule all that
      is needed? Are both of those truly needed?</p>
