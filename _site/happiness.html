    <main>
      <p>Want to start collecting some tidbits on happiness.
      Surprisingly, a lot of it seems to overlap with <a
      href="things-i-believe">things I believe</a> since happiness is a
      critical ingredient to playing the infinite game. Also might have
      some overlap with <a href="how-to-research">how to
      research</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>I have sneaking suspicion that anything that can be classified
      as infinite game will have principles which are aligned with
      happiness. (Something like <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">gacha games</a>
      are not applicable here even though they make you “happy”)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Related to the idea from <a href="rl">RL</a> that we’re not
      trying to maximize joy from each action but our long term value
      (happiness). Pulling from this analogy, it might also be that if
      we were truly optimal, running a lot and sleeping on time would
      bring us more immediate reward than the alternatives (lounging and
      binging). Perhaps a large part of happiness is optimizing our
      environment so that our “greedy” actions better reflect our
      long-term goals. This can be seen as reprogramming defaults or
      shifting our policy to better align with what we know is good.</p>
