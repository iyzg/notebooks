    <h1><a href="/"a>← Living computation, cities, &amp;
websites</a></h1>
    <p class="date">Dec 05, 2023 &ndash; Dec 05, 2023</p>
    <main>
      <p>What exactly is living computation? To me, this is a rough idea
      of having something which grows organically (here to mean without
      human intervention). In code, things can only grow stale and grow
      old, but it is rare (dare I say impossible) that a program that
      grows better over time. I feel the same way with cities. Any
      dynamism that is felt is because of the nature that is constantly
      changing and the people there who are constantly reinventing,
      maintaining, and adapting just <em>what</em> that city is.</p>
      <p>How could something grow better overtime by itself?</p>
      <p>This is closely evolution and the open-ended search that it is.
      It is the most innovative and creative process we have ever
      observed or come across. Just this minimal drive to survive is
      enough to create such variety.</p>
      <p>I’ve been thinking about this lately because what would it mean
      for a city to grow into itself? For buildings to adapt their shape
      to naturally accommodate what surrounds them. What does it mean
      for a website to grow <em>without</em> its creator? In a way, I’d
      like for everything I do to somehow make it back to this website
      to create a more nuanced image of myself. The questions tab hasn’t
      been updated in foreverrr.</p>
      <p>The city problem feels also impossible. To be a city means to
      be lived in, that there are <em>humans</em> (at least from this
      anthropogenic viewpoint). Could we create a city without humans?
      Can a city be built without purpose? Instead of places for humans
      to live in, what would it mean for a city to be truly alive? That
      would mean it has to meet the minimum criterion, of reproducing?
      What meme would a city replicate? To me, that would be the culture
      inside, but that culture is history, human history. There is no
      city because there is no human. But could there be something
      deeper down that a city is trying to propagate?</p>
      <p>It seems like fighting decay is a never ending process, and
      even if energy isn’t being put in on my part, something has to be
      putting in the energy to continually make anew. Somethings like
      link aggregators perhaps fit this bill or something like YouTube
      which is merely a content host, but their personalities are the
      work of human teams which constantly put in work.</p>
      <p>My website at the current moment <strong>feels</strong> dead.
      There are dates for when things were last updated, but you’re only
      ever looking at less dead webpages, not alive ones. Perhaps once I
      save links, they could automatically populate into my notebooks
      for me to inspect, but I’d like to think of some way for the
      accretion of moments and events and ideas that I call my life to
      be reflected on here. Even though we pretend like we have digital
      gardens, nothing grows here on its own. We cannot be surprised by
      what our website has become while we were gone. There are two
      options: stasis or decay. But that third option, that option of
      turning an <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Line">abandoned
      railroad</a> into a park, of life finding a way in the most
      hospitable of areas, how can <strong>that</strong> feeling be
      evinced in our creations?</p>
      <p>I’m not satisfied by using others as a fake front for
      aliveness, but I’m not sure we have a truly computational,
      non-human way to create this never ending novelty. That’s the
      problem I truly care about, so perhaps it’s time for a notebook on
      evolution.</p>
      <p>On evolution, there are some interesting things like the <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=helScS3coAE">demon
      horde sort</a> and the notion that our computing shouldn’t be
      correct first, it should be robust first. It should be made of
      tiny units that don’t require each other be perfect, but that they
      be “right enough”, whatever that may mean.</p>
      <p>Do we want cities to be alive?</p>
      <h3 id="what-are-some-solutions-to-this">What are some solutions
      to this?</h3>
      <p>One solution is the one you’re currently reading, that I use
      this site as my thinking ground (which I once did), but what if I
      find some other fad? No matter how I go about thinking, I have to
      put my thoughts into writing, and they have to go <em>online</em>
      somehow. Maybe the problem isn’t that this website is dead, but
      merely that the person inside, was. Well not literally, but
      perhaps creatively and intellectually.</p>
