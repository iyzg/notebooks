    <h1><a href="/"a>← Open Questions</a></h1>
    <p class="date">Apr 08, 2022 &ndash; Dec 23, 2023</p>
    <main>
      <p>List of questions I have about the world. More directed
      questions about topics can be found in various notebooks.</p>
      <p>If this list doesn’t quench your thirst for questions, feel
      free to check out <a

      <h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>How can you measure tradeoff between conformity and
      diversity?</strong> There is strength in diversity, but it seems
      like there is also a lot of social push for conformity. Is there
      an optimal balance? What kind of metrics would someone use to
      measure these?</li>
      <li><strong>Does evolution push for diversity and
      inclusion?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Do humans suffer from silent data corruption?</strong>
      If you flip any one base pair, are we really that fucked though?
      Very different compute paradigm than LLMs currently</li>
      <li><strong>Has human genome mutation rate dropped throughout
      history?</strong> When you run evolutionary algorithms that can
      adapt their mutation, organisms eventually converge to no mutation
      as that is the only stable state. In such a case, why haven’t we
      converged to that? Is it a controls problem where it is harder in
      the real world, is no mutation something bad enough to prevent it
      from happening?</li>
      <li><strong>How did life arise from abiotic components?</strong>
      Assembly theory might be a key here in the complexification of
      elements.</li>
      <li><strong>Why does nature restore focus?</strong> Could just
      staring up at the vastness of clouds also serve as a restoration
      mechanic?</li>
      <li><strong>Has technology domesticated us?</strong> Not fully
      checked yet, but story about sheep brains becoming smaller after
      domestication, and how that might happen to humans? Do all animal
      brains become smaller after domestication? Might ours also after
      we rely on AI for everything? Is this a valid fear?</li>
      <li><strong>Can LLMs be used as a form of networking
      service?</strong> Goodside has shown some use in finding
      interesting people to follow on Twitter, but can this idea be
      extended? Perhaps it can also help enrich reading lists too!</li>
      <li><strong>How did taste evolve?</strong> Better yet, how in the
      world do we convert foods into taste?</li>
      <li><strong>Why are there only 4 nucleic acids in DNA?</strong>
      How did these evolve and why do these building blocks work so
      well?</li>
      <li><strong>Why do genetic algorithms use bit-strings? Are there
      more robust underlying representations we might be able to use?
      Could we evolve more powerful genetic operators?</strong> Kenneth
      Stanley’s last paper at OpenAI kind of explores these ideas in
      more detail.</li>
      <li><strong>Can we “prompt engineer” humans?</strong> In the same
      way we now prompt AI models to elicit better responses, might the
      same concept be applicable to humans? Coud we iterate towards to
      infinity by letting models prompt themselves?</li>
      <li><strong>Is it possible to train AI smarter than
      ourselves?</strong> Might we be limiting it by making it use our
      language (both linguistic and mathematical). Could AI ever develop
      something beyond our furthest comprehension?</li>
      <li><strong>Are current AI models poisoning the
      datasets?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Is effective altruism overfitting?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Are we not giving children enough autonomy?</strong>
      <a
      href="https://blog.dennishackethal.com/posts/the-true-purpose-of-schools">Here</a>
      are some <a
      href="https://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/">sources</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Are humans intrinsically altruistic? Is altruism
      positive?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What would non-coercive education look like? Is this
      truly better than the conforming one we have today?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Are beauty or ethics objective?</strong> If so, how
      close can we get?</li>
      <li><strong>How close are we to simulating a
      universe?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>How do we escape the Great Stagnation?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What impact does telling someone they have a disease
      have on lifespan?</strong> This is not ethical. Very not ethical.
      But, it would be interesting to figure out.</li>
      <li><strong>Can the internet ever eliminate geographically
      regional advantages?</strong> Current thoughts are that it might
      replace it with its own form of “virtual niche” regional
      advantage? Link to paper where elite universities are losing their
      edge.</li>
      <li><strong>When does correlation become causation?</strong> My
      statistics professor linked me to a textbook on Causal Inference,
      but I haven’t had time to look into it yet.<a href="#fn1"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
      <li><strong>Why are curiosity and goal-orientation often at
      odds?</strong> I’ve been talking with Kanjun about this particular
      question, but I still haven’t found a satisfactory answer.</li>
      <li><strong>How can we quantify diversity? Just how “good” of a
      thing is it?</strong> Currently exploring in <a
      href="quantifying-diversity.md">Quantifying Diversity</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Is political/ideological unification bad?</strong>
      Thinking of states as individuals in a population based
      meta-heuristic searches like <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic
      algorithms</a>, would it not be best to have diverse set of
      beliefs? That said, too much fragmentation also seems bad because
      it leaves an inability to deeply explore any of the proposed
      paths.</li>
      <li><strong>Are there placebos in psychology?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Do “better” forms of note-taking result in better
      works? Is this something that can be generalized across
      fields?</strong> <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkastens</a>
      and <a href="https://roamresearch.com">note-taking apps with cog
      logos</a> are all the craze, but are their paradigms truly better
      or worth the time investment? For those exploring this topic, I
      highly recommend looking into Andy Matuschak’s writings.</li>
      <li><strong>How much of an effect do indirect genes have?</strong>
      Parents have genes they didn’t pass on, but they express the
      behavior which could lead to the child having the phenotype
      without the genotype. Is this a common occurrence? How strong of
      an impact does it have?</li>
      <li><strong>What are the differences between finite and infinite
      games? How do we encourage infiniteness?</strong> Explored with
      Chris Lakin.</li>
      <li><strong>How do we solve the tragedy of the commons?</strong>
      <a
      href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/TragedyoftheCommons.html">Based
      on the original paper written by Garrett Hardin</a></li>
      <li><strong>How can we increase individual/group creative
      capabilities?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>How does supplanting thinking affect
      knowledge?</strong> Recent rise of Codex, DALLE-2, and GPT-3
      suggest a feature where it’s more important to have creative ideas
      rather than technical prowess. Do these free us to focus on higher
      level issues? <span class="citation"
