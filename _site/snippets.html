    <main>
      <p>Seedling notes and shower thoughts looking for a permanent
      home. Fleshed out enough ideas get moved to more permanent
      notes.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested, I’m love to discuss these ideas <a

      Community Building as Developmental Deconstraint</h3>
      <p>There’s an idea of being a “tummler” or someone who warms the
      crowd to create a naturally forming community. <span
      class="citation"
      data-cites="hillmanalexBuildStrongCommunity2014">[@hillmanalexBuildStrongCommunity2014]</span></p>
      <p>This seems like an evolutionary deconstraint or something that
      allows for incremental development. For instance, consider an
      example where both A and B are looking to start a band. For a band
      to form in the community, both of them need to express interest at
      the same time. While our central leader C could form it himself,
      doing so makes them a single point of failure. By warming up the
      crowd, they’re able to get A and B to reach out on their own and
      create an organic community independent of the tummler.</p>
      <p>Note taking could also fit this paradigm of a evolutionary
      deconstraint. It prevents catastrophic failure of knowledge not
      accreting and allows for serendipitous collection of eclectic
      views.</p>
      <h3 id="ii.-usnews-ranking-correlations">II. USNews Ranking
      Correlations</h3>
      <p>Is school performance correlated to how rural the surrounding
      environs are?</p>
      <p>Do higher ranked schools have better parity between men/women
      in STEM fields?</p>
      <p>Do lower ranked schools play on different metrics to attract
      students? Comparative advantage but applied to schools. Why would
      every school try and compete on the same ranking? Has our
      obsession with single score “objective functions” for education
      improved or degraded the institutions themselves?</p>
      <h3 id="iii.-gans-expanding-distribution">III. GANs Expanding
      Distribution</h3>
      <p>Neural networks struggle with data which is out of their
      training distribution. Is it possible to use GANs to train
      resilient networks which can generalize better?</p>
      <h3 id="iv.-uncertain-religion">IV. Uncertain Religion</h3>
      <p>Idea discussed by <a
      href="https://michaelnotebook.com/cosmos/index.html">Michael
      Nielsen</a>.</p>
      <p>At the crux of religion is a faith in the face of uncertainty.
      I want to further explore the idea of faith in uncertainty.</p>
      <h3 id="v.-libraries-as-spaced-repetition">V. Libraries as Spaced
      Repetition</h3>
      <p>Are personal physical libraries as a form of spaced
      repetition?</p>
      <p>Rather than the standard idea of remembering atomic ideas,
      revisiting these complex works would help tease out new
      connections and insights.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>“No man ever steps in the same river twice. For it’s not the
      same river and he’s not the same man.”<br />

      <h3 id="vi.-topology-in-neural-networks">VI. Topology in Neural
      Networks</h3>
      <p>Why is our genome so small relative to our neural
      capacities?</p>
      <p>Much of animal behavior isn’t learned but rather innate to our
      brain architecture. <span class="citation"
      data-cites="zadorCritiquePureLearning2019">[@zadorCritiquePureLearning2019]</span>
      How can we create a small subset of rules that are primed for
      learning? <span class="citation"
      data-cites="finnModelAgnosticMetaLearningFast2017">[@finnModelAgnosticMetaLearningFast2017]</span></p>
      <p>Are bottlenecks to complexity, like a genome, essential to
      higher intelligence? Regularization techniques (L1, L2) are
      already a standard and shown to increase performance, so could
      longitudinal bottlenecks through evolution and a genome do
      likewise? If so, why?</p>
      <p>Could we harness bottlenecks through time in neural networks?
      Meta-learning?</p>
      <p>This topic is sort of addressed in <span class="citation"
      data-cites="kaznatcheevNothingMakesSense2022">@kaznatcheevNothingMakesSense2022</span>
      in how <strong>humans</strong> naturally are incorporating
      inductive biases that improve their performance!</p>
      <h3 id="vii.-vr-to-reality">VII. VR to Reality</h3>
      <p>How far away is VR from being as satisfying as interacting in
      the real world? What factors are necessary for it to reach that
      stage?</p>
      <p>There’s something deeply unsatisfying about digital
      interactions and their ephemeral nature to my personal aesthetics.
      Something to revisit in the future when the technology holds more
      promise and when I have more experience with cutting edge VR
      systems.</p>
      <h3 id="viii.-ai-alchemy">VIII. AI Alchemy</h3>
      <p>There have been a lot of papers writing about what current
      approaches to AI are missing from general intelligence (<span
      class="citation"
      data-cites="lakeBuildingMachinesThat2016">@lakeBuildingMachinesThat2016</span>,
      <span class="citation"
      data-cites="mitchellWhyAIHarder2021">@mitchellWhyAIHarder2021</span>),
      but I haven’t seen any approaches into building in those missing
      ingredients. This also raises of question of whether Clippy is
      truly dangerous and if AI can be intelligent without all the other
      components so integral to human intelligence.</p>
      <p>The current state of AI is such that we’re trying to push SOTA
      along which is very different than “science”. How did alchemy turn
      into chemistry, and how could we make the same transition in
      ML?</p>
      <h3 id="ix.-benchmark-for-benchmarks">IX. Benchmark for
      Benchmarks</h3>
      <p>What if we had a meta benchmark for AI benchmarks which
      evaluated how closely they correlated with the goal they were
      purporting to represent? Could this help us work towards AI that
      truly are more generalizable? This is basically a question of how
      to evaluate <em>construct validity</em>. Objective measure of
      arbitrary, subjective goals can lead to misleading hopes of
      progress.</p>
      <h3 id="x.-idle-games">X. Idle Games</h3>
      <p>Inspiration: <span class="citation"
      data-cites="spielItStartedJoke2019">@spielItStartedJoke2019</span></p>
      <p>How are these designed? Why are these so fun? Could they be
      used as a template to designing real environments? Template of
      encouraging exploring and tinkering in real world design? In a
      way, something like this might be accomplished with Roam Research
      or Anki repeatedly bringing up old ideas.</p>
      <h3 id="xi.-science-education">XI. Science Education</h3>
      <p>Why is it that science is “taught” in such a dry manner in
      schooling? Even then there is a firm focus on the scientific
      method, much of my college science education has been rote
      memorization rather than trying to answer interesting
      questions.</p>
      <p><a
      href="https://www.propublica.org/article/muscular-dystrophy-patient-olympic-medalist-same-genetic-mutation">Science</a>
      is this.</p>
      <h3 id="xii.-human-evolution">XII. Human Evolution</h3>
      <p>If evolution requires diverse genetic material to keep
      innovating, why is it that humans seek like-minded individuals? Is
      there any correlation between genetic similarity and behavioral
      similarity? How does the ability to impact and change the world
      affect behavior?</p>
      <h3 id="xiii.-adaptive-interfaces">XIII. Adaptive Interfaces</h3>
      <p>I wonder if we could use LLMs to creative interfaces that learn
      and adapt to a user. In the same way that vim starts to grow <a
      href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ivy/">with us</a> and suggests
      possible ways to add new keybinds for common keybinds and actions.
      We should lower the bar for customizing software.</p>
