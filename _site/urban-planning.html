      <p>TODO: Should draw inspiration from <a href="city-rankings">my
      city rankings</a>. Also super excited to visit Japan to get more
      ideas. (Check out <a href="books">Emergent Tokyo</a> for more on
      this.)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Think I have a maybe odd conception of urban planning as a
      “practical art”. Even though gorgeous architecture is
      awe-inspiring, a city is ultimately measured in how it allows the
      humans residing there to thrive. In a way, a good city is the one
      you don’t notice. The one that allows humans to do their thing and
      create, it’s a canvas really.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">TLDraw</a> has been getting a
      lot of attention because it is an online canvas that <em>gets out
      of your way</em> and lets you do magical things. That is what good
      urban planning does.</p>
      <p>The primary question I truly care about in Urban Design in how
      do we create cities that allow for kids from 10 - 100 to feel a
      sense of autonomy. You shouldn’t be trapped until you can get a
      car; that is genuinely such an alien way of living that we’ve just
      grown used to. Kids should not just have freedom, but be able to
      exercise it to go travel and live their life and explore their
      interests.</p>
      <p>I don’t remember exactly which episode, but I saw French kids
      riding the train by themselves on the show <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/@jetlagthegame/">Jet Lag</a>. I
      think the way it works in France is that they have some relative
      that comes and picks them up at the stop, but the fact they can
      travel on the train alone with other kids is amazing. Perhaps this
      is in relation to <a href="education">education</a>, but this idea
      that kids should learn to act mature and “grow up” while we still
      treat them as below that is ridiculous. If you expect them to take
      responsibility and learn to take matters into their own hands, you
      have to give them the opportunities to do that.</p>

      of cohesive communities?</li>
      <li>How can you apply the principles of good design to cities?
