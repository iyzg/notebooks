Something I've thought a bit about is how to increase my own sense of doing cool stuff and how to get others to also do cool stuff (cool as defined by them).

Something that is an example of this is building [505 semantic search](https://github.com/iyzg/505-semantic-search) which was just a rebranding of [emoji search](https://www.emojisearch.app/). Even though I copied over the code and adapted it, just being able to do that and figure out how each part worked helped me learn more about programming!

Open source is a big form of agency-boosting for sure.
