Something I've thought a bit about is how to increase my own sense of doing cool stuff and how to get others to also do cool stuff (cool as defined by them).

Something that is an example of this is building [505 semantic search](https://github.com/iyzg/505-semantic-search) which was just a rebranding of [emoji search](https://www.emojisearch.app/). Even though I copied over the code and adapted it, just being able to do that and figure out how each part worked helped me learn more about programming!

Open source is a big form of agency-boosting for sure.

Surprising connection of using [spaced repetition](spaced-repetition) as a form of agency boosting! I think being able to code things *without* using the internet/LLMs is extremely important in that it allows you to truly problem solve and gives you a greater sense of achievement. Plus, when you actually *do* use the internet, you can see where you went wrong and improve on what you did.
