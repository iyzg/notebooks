Compiling a tier list of every city I've visited along with some rationale behind why I think that. Very not comprehensive, and very much in need of more cities!

## S

### Paris

**2023 (~1 week)**

The most magical thing walking out of our Airbnb, going 2 blocks surrounded by beautiful architecture, and buying fresh groceries from a local store. Nothing else has come quite close to this. Also everything in Paris was just amazing, very glad I didn't suffer [Paris Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome).

### Toronto

**2023 (~3 days)**

All the perks of NY but clean.

### New York City

**2023 (~3 days)**

The metro system is amazing, and there was just so much to do and see. Absolute hodgepodge of cultures and personalities. Also the fact I could basically cross any street without fear of dying was a very nice reprieve from Orlando.

## A

## Boston

**2021 (~2 days)**

Walkable city with pretty architecture and surprisingly good food. I suppose MIT and Harvard... and BU and BC and [at least 20 other universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_metropolitan_Boston) are there, so if you like an academic vibe, then this is the place to be. To me, it's a prototypical Northeastern U.S. city.

## Charleston

**2022 (~1 week)**

Lots of culture here, and the whole city is pretty walkable! Lovely river, great farmer's markets, and you're never too far from nature. Even *after* getting stuck in the woods til 2am one of the days, this is still an A rating for me.

## San Diego

**2023 (~5 days)**

Temperate weather and absolute amazing Mexican food! Lots of pretty attractions, and I liked the less frenetic pace of the city and surrounding metro areas. But oh man, that mexican food was to die for, as in the 5 California burritos I consumed per day will probably kill me.

## B

### Hershey

**2017 — 2019 (2 years)**

There's a cool amusement park, and this is *the* Hershey, like the chocolate company. Once again, I think me living there makes me rate it a bit poorly, but it's a lovely little town. Just be aware that there's a non-zero chance it smells like manure while driving around.

### Ann Arbor

**2023 (~2 days)**

Quaint little college town, UM is a very pretty campus, and not much more to be said.

## C

### Lansing/East Lansing

**2023 (~3 months)**

Besides the [amazing ice cream](https://statenews.com/article/2023/09/the-mystery-behind-the-msu-dairy-store?ct=content_open&cv=cbox_latest), I don't think any normal human would want to come visit Lansing/East Lansing. Relatively quiet college town, but it is quite pretty and there are tons of nature trails.

### Beijing

**2018 (~1 week)**

Don't remember too much, but the smog was a very clear memory. Pretty sure there wasn't a single clear/sunny day, so although I liked the architecture, it's getting bumped down.

## D

### Detroit

**2023 (~2 days)**

Mildly felt like a ghost-town celebrating its past success while on last legs.

### Miami

**2019 — 2021, (2 years)**

Lived here and most of the time was during COVID, so I feel like this is a poor rating, but I can't rate it any higher. (I've never explored the city fully, so this is *definitely* an inaccurate rating you shouldn't listen to)

### Orlando

**2021- 2023, (2 years)**

Perhaps it's because I live here, but not much to write home about. Poor walkability and besides Disney, Orlando, and a few cute spots like Baldwin Park and Winter Garden, there isn't much to see.
