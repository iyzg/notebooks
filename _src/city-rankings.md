Compiling a tier list of every city I've visited along with some rationale behind why I think that. Very not comprehensive, and very much in need of more cities!

> Note: I'm ranking the cities off of how much I enjoyed them. I've spent varying amounts of time in different cities and visited them for very different reasons (sometimes I've lived in a place and other times it's just for tourism). This list is completely subjective and probably will mean nothing to you. I've also rated these cities at very different points in life, so keep that in mind as well.


## T

### Tokyo

**2024 (1 week)**

Special rank for Tokyo. First of all, their transit system is [profitable!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farebox_recovery_ratio#Oceania) which is genuinely not something you can find in the US. I haven't dug too deep into what's different, but the Tokyo Metro/JR Lines/Shinkansen are by the far the greatest metro system I've ever used, hands down. Beyond that, the food was amazing, culture was amazing, and might be my favorite city in the world now.

## S

### Paris

**2023 (~1 week)**

The most magical thing walking out of our Airbnb, going 2 blocks surrounded by beautiful architecture, and buying fresh groceries from a local store. Nothing else has come quite close to this. Also everything in Paris was just amazing, very glad I didn't suffer [Paris Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome).

### Toronto

**2023 (~3 days)**

All the perks of NY but clean.

### New York City

**2023 (~3 days)**

The metro system is amazing, and there was just so much to do and see. Absolute hodgepodge of cultures and personalities. Also the fact I could basically cross any street without fear of dying was a very nice reprieve from Orlando.

### Takayama

**2024 (2 days)**

Does Takayama really deserve to be an S tier city? Debatable. Am I putting it here because Hida Beef is pretty much the best food I have ever eaten? Possibly. I'm also putting it here because small Japanese city/towns are some of the most charming in the world. Genuinely loved the slower pace of life here, and the food and views were stunning.

## A

### Boston

**2021 (~2 days)**

Walkable city with pretty architecture and surprisingly good food. I suppose MIT and Harvard... and BU and BC and [at least 20 other universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_metropolitan_Boston) are there, so if you like an academic vibe, then this is the place to be. To me, it's a prototypical Northeastern U.S. city.

### Charleston

**2022 (~1 week)**

Lots of culture here, and the whole city is pretty walkable! Lovely river, great farmer's markets, and you're never too far from nature. Even *after* getting stuck in the woods til 2am one of the days, this is still an A rating for me.

### San Diego

**2023 (~5 days)**

Temperate weather and absolute amazing Mexican food! Lots of pretty attractions, and I liked the less frenetic pace of the city and surrounding metro areas. But oh man, that mexican food was to die for, as in the 5 California burritos I consumed per day will probably kill me.

## B

### Hiroshima

**2024 (2 days)**

Once again, this is not a fair ranking because... well. Right. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and historical significance alone makes it worth visiting, but the day trip to Miyajima (little island off the coast) made the trip far better and gave a nice sense of nature to the otherwise bustling city.

### Kyoto

**2024 (2 days)**

They have a really lovely train station that has an amazing light show at night, beautiful views as always. There's an amazing torii gate walk (the one with thousands of torii gates) and the Imperial Palace to boot. I was feeling quite under the weather, so this may not be the most accurate rating ever.

### Hershey

**2017 — 2019 (2 years)**

There's a cool amusement park, and this is *the* Hershey, like the chocolate company. Once again, I think me living there makes me rate it a bit poorly, but it's a lovely little town. Just be aware that there's a non-zero chance it smells like manure while driving around.

### Ann Arbor

**2023 (~2 days)**

Quaint little college town, UM is a very pretty campus, and not much more to be said.

## C

### Kanazawa

**2024 (2 days)**

Felt like a generic medium sized Japanese city. Some nice attractions and good food, but nothing to really right home about. That being said, you should visit their [Ninja Weapon Museum](https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/attractions/detail_52123.html)! Pretty quiet but peaceful.

### Lansing/East Lansing

**2023 (~3 months)**

Besides the [amazing ice cream](https://statenews.com/article/2023/09/the-mystery-behind-the-msu-dairy-store?ct=content_open&cv=cbox_latest), I don't think any normal human would want to come visit Lansing/East Lansing. Relatively quiet college town, but it is quite pretty and there are tons of nature trails.

### Beijing

**2018 (~1 week)**

Don't remember too much, but the smog was a very clear memory. Pretty sure there wasn't a single clear/sunny day, so although I liked the architecture, it's getting bumped down.

## D

### Detroit

**2023 (~2 days)**

Mildly felt like a ghost-town celebrating its past success while on last legs.

### Miami

**2019 — 2021, (2 years)**

Lived here and most of the time was during COVID, so I feel like this is a poor rating, but I can't rate it any higher. (I've never explored the city fully, so this is *definitely* an inaccurate rating you shouldn't listen to)

### Orlando

**2021- 2023, (2 years)**

Perhaps it's because I live here, but not much to write home about. Poor walkability and besides Disney & Universal Park, Orlando, and a few cute spots like Baldwin Park and Winter Garden, there isn't much to see. This is a place to visit for a weekend for the amusement parks, but I definitely wouldn't stay here long term.
