Humans cooperate, but so do cells, and then so do chemical autocatalytic cycles? What is the lowest level where we can say that "cooperation" occurs not as a law of physics, but as an evolved thing where it is beneficial to "work together". (This needs refining since *everything* is a law of physics)

Reading about the origin of life, it's interesting that they're talking about autopoiesis and how it might have evolved in a pre-biology standpoint just because it was favorable for chemical cycles to stick together. Is this then cooperation?
