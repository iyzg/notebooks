Consistently, subjects showed higher brain activations indorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex inthe post-test than inthe pre-test. Inaddition, there were significant positive correlations self-reported search impulse and brain responses inthe frontal areas. The results suggest that asimple six-day’s Internet search training can make people dependent on the search tools when facing unknown issues. People are easily dependent on the Internet search engines.

Overall, the available evidence indicates that the Internet can produce both acute and sustained alterations in each of these areas of cognition, which may be reflected in changes in the brain. However, an emerging priority for future research is to determine the effects of extensive online media usage on cognitive development in youth, and examine how this may differ from cognitive outcomes and brain impact of uses of Internet in the elderly. We conclude by proposing how Internet research could be integrated into broader research settings to study how this unprecedented new facet of society can affect our cognition and the brain across the life course.

Analysis showed a significant effect for both setting and use of a laptop as well as a significant interaction between setting and laptop use. A further analysis controlling for time spent focused on the laptop screen produced similar results.

No one has ever asked me how one should escape mimetic contagion on campus. Still here’s my answer: If one must go to college, I advise cultivating smaller social circles. Instead of going to class and preparing for exams, to go to the library and just read. Finally, not to join a fraternity or finance club, but to be part of a knitting circle or hiking group instead.

The needle mover for really changing your life is your environment. Living in the wrong city can drastically increase your odds of developing diabetes. People surrounded by runners start running themselves. The key to getting whatever you want (becoming happier, becoming smarter, quitting smoking, working more, working less, etc) is identifying an environment that has those virtues and immersing yourself in it. But how? “Environment” is just code for a collection of other people, places or things that you experience without applying continuous effort.
