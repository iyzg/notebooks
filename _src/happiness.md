Want to start collecting some tidbits on happiness. Surprisingly, a lot of it seems to overlap with [things I believe](things-i-believe) since happiness is a critical ingredient to playing the infinite game. Also might have some overlap with [how to research](how-to-research). 

> I have sneaking suspicion that anything that can be classified as infinite game will have principles which are aligned with happiness. (Something like [gacha games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game) are not applicable here even though they make you "happy")

Related to the idea from [RL](rl) that we're not trying to maximize joy from each action but our long term value (happiness). Pulling from this analogy, it might also be that if we were truly optimal, running a lot and sleeping on time would bring us more immediate reward than the alternatives (lounging and binging). Perhaps a large part of happiness is optimizing our environment so that our "greedy" actions better reflect our long-term goals. This can be seen as reprogramming defaults or shifting our policy to better align with what we know is good.
