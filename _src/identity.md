I've been thinking about habits recently and how about the most important thing isn't doing 100% everyday, but by establishing an identity that you are a person who does the habit. Even if you just write a line a day, you become a writer. A writer is someone who writes.

In the inverse, I feel like it's possible to lose identity. For the longest time, I've stopped programming besides for school except in small spurts, and I've lost that feeling of being a programmer. It's been weird coming to odds with the fact that just because you have a "CS" degree, if you aren't programming, then you aren't a programmer. So until I get back to having fun and tinkering around, I'm not sure I can call myself a programmer.
