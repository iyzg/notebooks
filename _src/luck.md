Place to store my ideas on creating luck and serendipity.

Note that sometimes "creating luck" is not really luck, just that you are prepared. Generally, my thoughts on luck isn't that you're optimizing to be the $\frac{1}{\infty}$ universes where you succeed, but to ensure most of those will succeed. It's about raising your expected value which means you have to have skills that just so happen to be augmented by luck.

A decent subsection of what [what I believe](what-i-believe) relies on this notion of luck. You should always be reaching out to interesting people and increasing your general surface area of serendipity.
