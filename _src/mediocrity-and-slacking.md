## Thoughts

From The Rise and Fall of Great American Cities, I've been thinking about how housing is kind of reliant on slack. You don't always want the most efficient housing as that creates monotonous neighborhoods. Rather have a mix so you don't crowd out [diversity](diversity). Both diversity and evolution require slack for better results. Are current [AI](ai) methods not sufficient for true intelligence because they don't have any slack in them? It is sheer iteration towards better. How could you encourage slack in AIs? Maybe with some sort of ensemble type where you tolerate worse ones temporarily in a two layer optimization.
