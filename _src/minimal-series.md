The Minimal Series (name yet not determined) is a series of notebooks that take you from Andrej Karpathy's [Micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) to writing and understanding other machine learning and reinforcement learning concepts. I'm hoping to write the cleanest code possible while helping you understand the underlying concepts.

### General ML

- [MLP](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15CCZv7hkWca5n7h17sPLoZ5hGXyOhpOR?usp=sharing)

### RL

## TODO:

- RNN
- CNN
- GRU
- LSTM
- Transformer
- Policy Gradient
- NEAT
- ES
- GA
- Entropy which leads to KL divergence
- Ant Colony Optimization
- Simulated Annealing
