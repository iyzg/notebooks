I want to start these little time based blocks where I challenge myself, go out of my comfort zone, and hopefully end up on the other side with a better idea of self.

## Trial Run

I'm going to try a little rough draft of this and try to create a digital ecosystem in JS in about one month.

## Future Ones

- Shaders
- Urban design?
