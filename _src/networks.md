Collecting a set of notes while I take a class on Network Algorithms.

The small world hypothesis is really kind of insane. Like the fact that you can be connected to any other human in 5-6 jumps is wild. This also increases the point of reaching out to people that you don't have a link to. If you cold-email people, you'll find that you can rapidly expand that graph of people you know. This sort of ties into [what I believe in](things-i-believe) and how being the random link in these graphs is extremely powerful.

## Questions

- Isn't it incredible that the humans could figure out who to send the letter to in the small-world problem?
- How does average distance change over time?
