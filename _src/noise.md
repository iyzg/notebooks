A subsection of [complex systems](complex-systems) focused on how our life is noisy. Noise by itself is not inherently good or bad. Although we tend to think of it as something to get rid of to find a signal, noise can be beneficial (think noise in mutations or using it to break symmetries).

For more on beneficial noise, there is an idea in [computational linguistics](comp-linguistics) that there is an optimal level of "noise" in communication for language acquisition. Our AI is trained with noisy gradients (SGD), and we oftentimes try to inject noise into their inputs so they better learn to find the true signal.
