Been really curious about what makes a good website! Figured I'd curate some of my favorites:

- [Muan](https://muan.co/)
- [Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/)
- [Anson Yu](https://ansonyu.me/)
- [Gwern](https://gwern.net/)
- [Michael Nielsen](https://michaelnotebook.com/)
- [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)

Also [judah](https://webcraft.joodaloop.com/) makes really neat websites for inspo!
