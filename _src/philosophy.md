General placeholder for philosophy ideas I'm interested in.

## Induction

How can you know something is true? See the [Grue Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_riddle_of_induction). Also related to the idea of "black swans" where infinite white swan observations cannot tell you that there are no black swans.

Also related to idea of science where science is falsifiable things. It is never certain, just the most we can be sure at any moment, but no scientific theory is every correct. (Need to read Popper).
