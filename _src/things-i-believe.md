A not so comprehensive list of things that I believe in yet to be categorized or rigorously examined.

- The [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) is real, and you should live accordingly.

### Long Tails Galore

Most things in life worth aiming for are very long shots and success is sampled from a long tailed distribution.

Because of this:

- Maximize the amount of time you're taking shots
- Maximize shots/time
- Maximize long term success/shot

What you prioritize and to what degree depend on the application of this idea.

If the game you're playing doesn't respect these rules, ask yourself if the game is worth playing.
