> **tldr | Life is  an infinite game; everything else is commentary.**

A not so comprehensive list of things that I believe in yet to be categorized or rigorously examined.

- The [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) is real, and you should live accordingly.

### Long Tails Galore

Most things in life worth aiming for are very long shots and success is sampled from a long tailed distribution.

![An example of a very long tail](_assets/long_tail.svg)

Because of this:

- Maximize the amount of time you're taking shots
- Maximize shots/time
- Maximize long term success/shot

What you prioritize and to what degree depend on the application of this idea.

If the game you're playing doesn't respect these rules, ask yourself if the game is worth playing.

### Misc.

- Satisfice over maximize.
  - You know, this kind of conflicts with the three things that say maximize above lol
  - oh well
- Everyone benefits when you're unique. Homogeneity hurts the whole. It is not selfish, but selfless, to take time to yourself and disconnect.
